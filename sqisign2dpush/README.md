# C implementation of SQIsign2DPush with cached dual isogenies

## Project Background

This project is a modified C implementation based on [isec-tut/SQIsign2DPush](https://github.com/isec-tut/SQIsign2DPush), using commit `9785f0d660105fc23bbd276f7f197c59b249897f` as the baseline recorded in this repository's initial commit.
It also uses the [SQIsign-v2.0](https://github.com/SQIsign/the-sqisign/tree/nist-v2) and [SQIsignHD-v1.0](https://github.com/Pierrick-Dartois/SQIsignHD-lib/tree/v1) codebases.

The original README content, beginning with the [# C implementation of SQIsign2DPush](#C-implementation-of-SQIsign2DPush) heading, is retained below as the project's detailed reference documentation.

## Project Additions

This project adds the following functionality:

- A cached-parameter dual HD-isogeny signing path: data produced while computing the original HD isogeny are temporarily stored and directly reused to compute the corresponding dual isogeny, avoiding an independent recomputation.
- A cached-parameter dual 1D-isogeny signing path using the same temporary-storage and direct-reuse approach for the corresponding dual computation.
- Selectable original and new signing algorithms through `--method=ori|new|both`.
- Round-trip tests for public keys, secret keys, and signatures for both signing paths.
- Configurable benchmark iterations through `--iterations=num`, together with selectable benchmark methods.
- CMake integration for the `lvl1`, `lvl3`, and `lvl5` parameter sets, including separate test and benchmark outputs.

## Current Build, Run, and Test

The finite-field backend is selected at CMake configure time. Use separate
build directories when switching between the `ref` and `fiat_crypto` backends
because the selection is stored in the CMake cache.

### Build

Build the default `ref` backend:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-ref -DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=ref -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-ref -j"$(nproc)"
```

Build the `fiat_crypto` backend in its own build directory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-fiat-crypto -DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=fiat_crypto -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-fiat-crypto -j"$(nproc)"
```

### Run tests

Build and run the level-1 test for the `ref` backend:

```sh
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl1
./build-ref/test/sqisign2dpush_lvl1 --method=both
```

Replace `lvl1` with `lvl3` or `lvl5` for the other parameter sets.

The `--method` option accepts `ori`, `new`, or `both`; the default is `both`.

For the `fiat_crypto` backend, replace `build-ref` with `build-fiat-crypto`

### Benchmarks

Build and run the level-1 benchmark for the `ref` backend:

```sh
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_bench_sqisign2dpush_lvl1
./build-ref/bench/sqisign2dpush_lvl1 --iterations=100 --method=both
```

Replace `lvl1` with `lvl3` or `lvl5` for the other parameter sets.

The benchmark accepts `--iterations=num` and `--method=ori|new|both` in either order.

Both options are optional; the defaults are `100` iterations and `both` method.

For the `fiat_crypto` backend, replace `build-ref` with `build-fiat-crypto`

```

Many modules use `lvl1`, `lvl3`, and `lvl5` for parameter-specific files,
with shared code in directories such as `lvlx`, `ecx`, or `generic`.
Module tests are located in their respective `test/` directories.
The `src/ec-old/` and `src/gf-old/` directories contain legacy code.
Local build directories such as `build-ref/` and `build-fiat-crypto/` are
generated by CMake and ignored by Git.

## Build and test

### Requirements

- CMake (version 3.13 or later)
- C99-compatible C compiler and an assembler
- GMP development files, unless building GMP with `-DENABLE_GMP_BUILD=ON`
- Make, or another build tool supported by the selected CMake generator

### Backend selection

The finite-field implementation is selected at CMake configure time with
`SQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE`:

| Build type | Previous name | Finite-field source | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ref` (default) | `optimized` | `src/gf/ref` | modarith-generated `fp_backend.c` |
| `fiat_crypto` | `ref` | `src/gf/fiat_crypto` | Fiat-Crypto-based `fp_hd256.c`, `fp_hd384.c`, and `fp_hd512.c` |

Each backend uses the matching constants under `src/precomp/ref` or
`src/precomp/fiat_crypto`. To keep using the former `ref` implementation,
configure with `-DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=fiat_crypto`.

Use separate build directories when switching between backends because the
choice is stored in the CMake cache.

### Build

Build the default `ref` backend:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-ref -DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=ref -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-ref -j"$(nproc)"
```

To build the Fiat-Crypto finite-field backend instead:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-fiat-crypto -DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=fiat_crypto -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-fiat-crypto -j"$(nproc)"
```

### Run tests

The SQIsign2DPush implementation and its protocol tests are shared by both
configurations. To build one level only, run one of the following commands
with the selected build directory:

```sh
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl1
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl3
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl5
```

Here `lvl1`, `lvl3`, and `lvl5` are the three parameter sets. Larger levels are
slower and correspond to stronger security parameters.

After building, run the matching test binary:

```sh
./build-ref/src/sqisign2dpush/ref/lvl1/test/sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl1
./build-ref/src/sqisign2dpush/ref/lvl3/test/sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl3
./build-ref/src/sqisign2dpush/ref/lvl5/test/sqisign_test_sqisign2dpush_lvl5
```

The encoding round-trip test can also be run directly:

```sh
./build-ref/src/sqisign2dpush/ref/lvl1/test/sqisign_test_encoding_lvl1
```

For the `fiat_crypto` configuration, use `build-fiat-crypto` as the build
directory in these commands. Protocol test binaries are still under
`src/sqisign2dpush/ref` within that build directory.

### Build options

CMake build options can be specified with `-D<BUILD_OPTION>=<VALUE>`.

#### SQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE

Selects the finite-field backend described in [Backend selection](#backend-selection).

The aliases `optimized` and `opt` are accepted by CMake and normalized to `ref`.
The former `ref` backend is now named `fiat_crypto`; use that value to retain
the previous Fiat-Crypto implementation.
The `broadwell` and `arm64crypto` values remain available for the platform-specific
backends supported by the base project.

#### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Can be used to specify special build types. The options are:

- `Release`: Builds with optimizations enabled and assertions disabled.
- `Debug`: Builds with debug symbols.
- `ASAN`: Builds with AddressSanitizer memory error detector.
- `LSAN`: Builds with LeakSanitizer for run-time memory leak detection.
- `UBSAN`: Builds with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer for undefined behavior detection.

The default build type uses the flags `-O3 -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-error=strict-prototypes -fvisibility=hidden -Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration -Wno-error=attributes`. (Notice that assertions remain enabled in this configuration, which harms performance.)

#### ENABLE_GMP_BUILD

If set to `OFF` (by default), the gmp library on the system is dynamically linked.
If set to `ON`, a custom gmp library is linked, which is built as part of the overall build process.

In the latter case, the following further options are available:

- `ENABLE_GMP_STATIC`: Does static linking against gmp. The default is `OFF`.
- `GMP_BUILD_CONFIG_ARGS`: Provides additional config arguments for the gmp build (for example `--disable-assembly`). By default, no config arguments are provided.

#### ENABLE_DOCS

If set to `OFF` (by default), documentation targets are not configured. If set
to `ON`, Doxygen is required and the `doc` target is added:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_DOCS=ON
cmake --build build --target doc
```

## Benchmarks

### SQIsign2DPush

The `sqisign_bench_sqisign2dpush_lvl{1,3,5}` binary accepts an optional
iteration count; the default is 3. It performs all key generations first,
then all signatures, and finally all verifications. For example:

```sh
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_bench_sqisign2dpush_lvl1
./build-ref/src/sqisign2dpush/ref/lvl1/test/sqisign_bench_sqisign2dpush_lvl1 100
```

On x86/x86-64, cycle counts use `rdtsc`; other platforms use the `clock`
fallback. The benchmark reports average, standard deviation, median, minimum,
and maximum in MCycles, followed by average CPU time in milliseconds.

Each phase also reports four disjoint CPU-time categories:

- `isogeny`: one- and two-dimensional isogeny computation, including
  `ec_eval_*`, `isog_init_*`, and theta-isogeny chains.
- `elliptic-curve`: elliptic-curve and basis work outside the isogeny category,
  such as basis changes, scalar multiplication, pairings, dlogs, kernel setup,
  and matrix application.
- `ideal/quaternion`: quaternion, ideal, lattice, `represent_integer`, and
  `sample_response` processing.
- `other`: the residual CPU time, including hashing, setup, final checks, and
  bookkeeping.

The category percentages use the average CPU time of the corresponding phase
as the denominator. The `other` value is calculated as the total phase time
minus the first three categories, so small rounding residuals are expected.
The exact values depend on the CPU, compiler, build type, parameter level, and
iteration count. A representative level-1 output is:

```text
keygen completed
sign completed
verify completed

SQIsign2DPush benchmark (1 iterations)
CPU cycles: rdtsc
  keygen  average 51.982, stddev 0.000, median 51.982, min 51.982, max 51.982 MCycles

```

### Finite-field arithmetic

The finite-field test binaries accept either `test <reps>` for correctness
tests or `bench <reps>` for cycle-count benchmarks. For example, to benchmark
the level 1 $GF(p)$ and $GF(p^2)$ arithmetic from the repository root:

```sh
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_gf_lvl1_fp
cmake --build build-ref --target sqisign_test_gf_lvl1_fp2

./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl1/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl1_fp bench 100000
./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl1/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl1_fp2 bench 100000
```

The corresponding level 3 and level 5 binaries are:

```sh
./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl3/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl3_fp bench 100000
./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl3/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl3_fp2 bench 100000
./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl5/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl5_fp bench 100000
./build-ref/src/gf/ref/lvl5/test/sqisign_test_gf_lvl5_fp2 bench 100000
```

For a Fiat-Crypto build, replace `build-ref/src/gf/ref` with
`build-fiat-crypto/src/gf/fiat_crypto`.

## Implementation details

### Finite-field backend and code generation

In a `fiat_crypto` build, the basic `Fp` operations use `fp_hd256.c` for level 1,
`fp_hd384.c` for level 3, and `fp_hd512.c` for level 5. These files contain
[Fiat-Crypto](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto) generated routines and
specialized multiplication and squaring routines. A `ref` build uses
the generated backend under `src/gf/ref/lvl{1,3,5}` instead.

Each level's `fp_exp.c` contains pre-generated schedules for the fixed
exponents `(p-3)/4` and `(p+1)/4`. Inversion in `fp.c` uses the former;
square roots use the latter. Normal builds use the checked-in C files and
do not require Python. To regenerate or check the `ref` backend's arithmetic
primitives and fixed-exponent schedules:

```sh
python3 scripts/gen_fp_backend.py
python3 scripts/gen_fp_fixed.py
python3 scripts/gen_fp_backend.py --check
python3 scripts/gen_fp_fixed.py --check
```

These scripts write to `src/gf/ref/lvl{1,3,5}`.

For representation details and benchmark results, see [the v2-style representation, limb widths and benchmark results (Japanese)](docs/fp-v2-backend-ja.md).

The SQIsign v2.0 reference implementation also uses Michael Scott's
[modarith](https://github.com/mcarrickscott/modarith) to generate its finite-field
arithmetic (`src/gf/ref`), as documented in its
[README acknowledgements](https://github.com/SQISign/the-sqisign/tree/nist-v2#acknowledgements).
This repository vendors modarith's [`monty.py`](scripts/vendor/monty.py) from
commit `dcdd51a3f49af0462d7a50f3bbdf63588c9f0cc0` and uses it through
[`scripts/gen_fp_backend.py`](scripts/gen_fp_backend.py) to generate C code.
Signing and verification use the generated C code; they do not run the Python
generator. The vendored revision has not been verified to be identical to the
revision used to generate SQIsign v2.0's reference implementation.

### Encoded formats

The two backends expose the same field API and the same canonical byte
encoding. Montgomery limbs and backend-specific internal layouts are never
written directly to the public key, secret key, or signature encoding.


The encoded formats are defined by the mathematical object, not by the
finite-field limb layout. The current sizes are:

| Level | Public key | Secret key | Signature |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| lvl1 | 66 bytes | 455 bytes | 151 bytes |
| lvl3 | 98 bytes | 679 bytes | 219 bytes |
| lvl5 | 130 bytes | 899 bytes | 295 bytes |

`fp_encode` writes a canonical little-endian field element and `fp_decode`
restores the backend's internal representation. The legacy hash path uses
`fp_encode_legacy_hash` explicitly so that the protocol hash input remains
compatible with the established format.

### Integer representation

`represent_integer` follows the signed-coordinate search and small-prime
two-square solver in [hiroshi-onuki/SQIsign2D-Push](https://github.com/hiroshi-onuki/SQIsign2D-Push).
It preserves the requested norm and retries nonprimitive candidates within
a bounded search.

### Response sampling

`sample_response` follows the public Julia implementation's
`element_for_response` search. After LLL reduction it enumerates the
short-vector candidates of the resulting positive-definite quadratic form,
reduces the coefficient vector by its gcd, and accepts a nonzero candidate
whose normalized norm is below `2^EXPONENT_TWO` and coprime to 3. It does not
use the former random `m=10` candidate box or a fixed inner attempt limit.
Protocol signing retries the outer response construction in the same way as
the Julia implementation when a response construction step fails.
